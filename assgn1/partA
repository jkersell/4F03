Part a

First initialize everything by allocating memory and filling A and b with 
random values. Divide A into enough groups of rows to distribute them to each
process. Once A is divided up, each chunk is sent to a process, along with b.
Each process then computes it's section of the product and sends the result
back to process 0. Process zero combines the results and prints it.

Pseudo Code:

A[m][n]
b[n]

for i=0..m
  for j=0..n
    A[i][j] = randomValue()
  endfor
endfor

for i=0..n
  b[i] = randomValue()
endfor

rowsPerProcess = m / processCount

for i=0..processCount
  send(rowsPerProcess many rows from A)
  send(b)
endfor

computeDotProduct(myChunkOfA)

result = combineResults()

print(result)
